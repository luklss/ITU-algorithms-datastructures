\section{Tests}

  We have run our sorting algorithm on the following inputs from the book. All input files were sorted, their respective sizes are indicated in parentheses:
    {\tt tiny.txt} (9 Strings of 1 char), {\tt words3.txt} (11 Strings of 3 char), {\tt 1letter.txt} (1 String of 1 char), {\tt 2letter.txt} (2 Strings of 1 char), {\tt empty.txt} (empty), and {\tt medium.txt} (2,000 Strings of various 2--6 char).

  \label{Fig:doubles}
  \end{marginfigure}

  The algorithm fails on medium.txt to the extend that it disregards the decimal point (see Figure \ref{Fig:doubles}). This error is due to the program always treating the input as strings. We expect that parsing the input as doubles would solve the problem.

  \section{Extensions}  

  Our {\tt FancyRunsort} implementation switches to insertion sort for sequences of length at most 8.
  We performed tests with and without this extension for our input files of sizes 0, 1, 2, 9, 11 and 2000 Strings but
  we were not able to detect major differences in running time (see Figure \ref{Fig:plot}).
